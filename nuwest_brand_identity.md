# nuwest.ai Brand Identity Pack

## Core Identity
**Name:** nuwest.ai  
**Logomark:** `nuwest.ai >` (typographic; no graphic mark)  
**Brand Essence:** Practical security, measurable truth, no theatre.

### Brand Story (Tone: Dry, Understated, Slightly Wry)
nuwest.ai exists because most of the security industry is still performing theater. People buy tools to look secure, produce reports to feel secure, and present dashboards to reassure each other that security is happening somewhere, probably. We don’t do any of that. We build small, sharp systems that ask simple questions like *“Is this actually secure?”* and then they go and find out. The brand is yellow and black because that’s a warning sign, not a mood board, and the “>” is because things should do something when you run them. This is a working company. If you want performance art, there are plenty of blue logos to choose from.

## Visual System

### Primary Colors
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Signal Yellow** | `#FFD300` | Primary highlight, callouts, keylines |
| **Black** | `#000000` | Primary background, typography |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Secondary text contrast when needed |

**Color Philosophy:**  
Yellow + Black is a *functional warning palette*, not an aesthetic trend. It signals inspection, verification, measurement, and truth-finding.

---

### Typography
**Primary Typeface:** Chakra Petch (Google Font)  
Weights used: **Regular**, **Medium**, **Semibold**, **Bold**

```
nuwest.ai >
```
- Use **Semibold or Bold** for brand signature.
- Maintain letter spacing tight but not touching.
- The `>` should remain typographically literal — no custom arrow shapes.

### System Guidance
- Avoid rounded, bubbly, or corporate-friendly font variants.
- Avoid unnecessary gradients or glow effects.
- Keep everything clean, minimal, intentional.

---

## Layout & Spacing
- Use **generous whitespace**. Let the message stand without decoration.
- Leading should be slightly tight to convey precision.
- Headlines can be short, declarative statements.
- Avoid decorative iconography unless strictly functional.

Example Header Composition:
```
nuwest.ai >
Measurable Security. No Theatre.
```

## Tone & Voice

### Voice Qualities
| Trait | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Dry** | Humor exists, but quietly, and without signaling it. |
| **Direct** | State the point. Short sentences are allowed. |
| **Measured** | Claims must be provable. Avoid hype. |
| **Unimpressed** | We do not perform “wow.” We perform “works.” |

### Writing Style Principles
- Do not oversell.  
- Avoid jargon unless it describes something real.  
- If something is unknown, say so plainly.  
- Use understatement instead of exaggeration.

Example:
> “Secure” is not a feeling. It is a measurement.

| Product | Display Format |
|--------|----------------|
